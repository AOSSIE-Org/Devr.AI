# Enhanced FAQ Handler with Web Search for Organizational Queries

## Overview

This implementation fulfills the feature request for an enhanced FAQ Handler that leverages web search to answer general, high-level questions about the Devr.AI organization. The system provides dynamic, up-to-date information by searching official sources and synthesizing comprehensive responses.

## Features Implemented

### üåü Core Capabilities

1. **Intelligent Query Classification**: Automatically detects whether a question is about organizational information or technical support
2. **Dynamic Web Search**: Performs targeted web searches for organizational queries using official sources
3. **LLM-Enhanced Synthesis**: Uses AI to synthesize search results into comprehensive, accurate answers
4. **Source Attribution**: Provides clear citations and links to official sources
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing static FAQ responses

### üîç Organizational Query Detection

The system recognizes queries such as:
- "What is Devr.AI all about?"
- "What projects does this organization work on?"
- "What are the main goals of Devr.AI?"
- "What platforms does Devr.AI support?"
- "How does this organization work?"

### üéØ Technical Query Support

Maintains support for existing technical FAQs:
- "How do I contribute?"
- "How do I report a bug?"
- "How to get started?"
- "What is LangGraph?"

## Architecture

### Components Created

1. **Enhanced FAQ Tool** (`enhanced_faq_tool.py`)
   - Core logic for query classification and web search
   - Pattern-based organizational query detection
   - Targeted search query generation
   - Response synthesis and source management

2. **Organizational FAQ Handler** (`organizational_faq.py`) 
   - Specialized handler for organizational queries
   - LLM-powered response synthesis
   - Advanced formatting and source attribution

3. **Enhanced Prompts** (`organizational_faq_prompt.py`)
   - Query classification prompts
   - Search query generation prompts
   - Response synthesis prompts
   - Fallback response prompts

4. **Updated Components**
   - Modified existing `faq_tool.py` to use enhanced functionality
   - Updated `faq.py` handler with enhanced response handling
   - Enhanced ReAct supervisor prompt for better routing

## Workflow

### Step 1: Query Reception
User asks a question ‚Üí FAQ Handler receives the query

### Step 2: Query Classification
```python
# Example: "What projects does Devr.AI work on?"
is_organizational = _is_organizational_query(question)
# Returns: True
```

### Step 3: Search Query Generation
```python
search_queries = [
    "Devr.AI open source projects",
    "Devr.AI GitHub repositories", 
    "Devr.AI projects developer relations"
]
```

### Step 4: Web Search Execution
- Performs targeted searches using Tavily Search API
- Focuses on official sources (website, GitHub, documentation)
- Deduplicates results by URL

### Step 5: Response Synthesis
- Uses LLM to synthesize search results
- Maintains accuracy by only using information from search results
- Formats response with proper structure and citations

### Step 6: Response Delivery
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "answer": "Devr.AI primarily focuses on creating tools for developer relations...",
  "sources": [
    {"title": "Devr.AI - Official Website", "url": "https://devr.ai/projects"},
    {"title": "Devr.AI on GitHub", "url": "https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI"}
  ],
  "type": "organizational_faq"
}
```

## Integration Points

### ReAct Supervisor Integration
The ReAct supervisor now intelligently routes organizational queries to the FAQ handler:

```python
# Enhanced decision logic:
# - Organizational questions ‚Üí faq_handler
# - Technical questions ‚Üí faq_handler  
# - External research ‚Üí web_search
# - GitHub operations ‚Üí github_toolkit
```

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing technical FAQ responses preserved
- Legacy API methods maintained
- Graceful fallback to static responses if web search fails

## Usage Examples

### Organizational Query
**Input**: "What kind of projects does Devr.AI work on?"

**Process**:
1. Detects organizational query
2. Generates search queries: "Devr.AI open source projects", "Devr.AI GitHub repositories"
3. Searches web for current information
4. Synthesizes response from official sources
5. Returns comprehensive answer with citations

**Output**: 
```
Devr.AI primarily focuses on creating tools for developer relations (DevRel), 
including AI-powered assistants for community engagement, issue triage, and 
onboarding. You can explore our main projects on our official website and GitHub page.

**Sources:**
1. [Devr.AI - Official Website](https://devr.ai/projects)
2. [Devr.AI on GitHub](https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/Devr.AI)
```

### Technical Query
**Input**: "How do I contribute to Devr.AI?"

**Process**:
1. Matches against static technical FAQ
2. Returns immediate response

**Output**:
```
You can contribute by visiting our GitHub repository, checking open issues, 
and submitting pull requests. We welcome all types of contributions including 
code, documentation, and bug reports.
```
