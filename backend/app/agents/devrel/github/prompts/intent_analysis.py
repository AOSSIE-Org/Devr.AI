USER QUERY: {user_query}

Classification guidelines:
- github_support: 
  - ALWAYS classify as `github_support` if the query asks about:
    - repository information
    - stats (stars, forks, watchers, issues)
    - open issues, closed issues, or "what issues"
    - description, license, URL, metadata
    - any question containing "<repo> repo", "repository", "repo", "issues in", "stars in", "forks in"
  - Example queries:
    - "What all issues are in Dev.ai repo?" → github_support
    - "How many stars does Devr.AI repo have?" → github_support
    - "Show me forks of Aossie-org/Dev.ai" → github_support
- contributor_recommendation: 
  * "who should review this PR/issue?"
  * "find experts in React/Python/ML"
  * "recommend assignees for stripe integration"
  * "best people for database optimization"
  * URLs like github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
  * "I need help with RabbitMQ, can you suggest some people?"
- repo_support: Code structure, dependencies, impact analysis, architecture
- issue_creation: Creating bugs, features, tracking items
- documentation_generation: Docs, READMEs, guides, explanations
- find_good_first_issues: Beginners, newcomers, "good first issue"
- web_search: Only for information that cannot be found through GitHub API (like news, articles, external documentation)
- general_github_help: General GitHub questions not covered above

IMPORTANT: Repository information queries (issues count, stars, forks, description) should ALWAYS use github_support, not web_search.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY raw JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, no explanation text.
