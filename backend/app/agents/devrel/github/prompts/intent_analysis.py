Classification guidelines:
- github_support: ANY questions about repository information, stats, issues count, stars, forks, description, URL, or repository metadata. This includes "how many issues", "what are the stars", "repository details", etc.
- contributor_recommendation: 
  * "who should review this PR/issue?"
  * "find experts in React/Python/ML"
  * "recommend assignees for stripe integration"
  * "best people for database optimization"
  * URLs like github.com/owner/repo/issues/123
  * "I need help with RabbitMQ, can you suggest some people?"
- repo_support: Code structure, dependencies, impact analysis, architecture
- issue_creation: Creating bugs, features, tracking items
- documentation_generation: Docs, READMEs, guides, explanations
- find_good_first_issues: Beginners, newcomers, "good first issue"
- web_search: Only for information that cannot be found through GitHub API (like news, articles, external documentation)

IMPORTANT: Repository information queries (issues count, stars, forks, description) should ALWAYS use github_support, not web_search.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY raw JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, no explanation text.
